            <h1>General Guidelines</h1>
            <h2>Respect other Members</h2>
            <bodytext>When you join you are agreeing to show the base level of respect towards other members.</bodytext>
            <h2>RP around your schedule</h2>
            <bodytext>Some roleplays or events may be shorter or longer. Be aware of this and how often you plan to RP before engaging in a serious or long standing plot, or find graceful ways to remove yourself from the plot. For emergencies, please contact the GM so that other players can continue the plot.</bodytext>
            <h2>Stay IC in IC areas</h2>
            <bodytext>Chats can easily become cluttered in game so being mindful of posting any OOC messages is important. Use tells or party chats to handle OOC messages between players.</bodytext>
            <h2>Stick to the setting when you are in the setting</h2>
            <bodytext>When you are roleplaying in the setting or t setting events, only events within the setting should be mentioned or referred to. Your RP and events outside of the setting are yours to curate and have but they must never be brought into the setting.</bodytext>
            <h2>Common Sense & Maturity</h2>
            <bodytext>Whether it comes to conflict resolution or simply chatting between members we expect common sense and maturity to be used in every situation.</bodytext>
            <h2>Growth & Stability, if it needs change it will be changed.</h2>
            <bodytext>As this setting develops more rules may be added. We expect members to adhere to these new rules as they are made aware of them.</bodytext>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: left;" class="section">
            <h1>Prohibited Behaviors</h1>
            <text>
                These behaviors, if performed maliciously or continuously after warning, will get a member removed from the community.</text>
                <h2>God-Modding</h2>
                <bodytext>God modding is when a character features god-like abilities such as invincibility, mind control, or other unrealistic powers that might not fit in with the setting.</bodytext>
                <h2>Metagaming</h2>
                <bodytext>While you are free to discuss with other members the plots or occurrences, this knowledge cannot be applied to your character. If your character was not there, they don't know and it cannot be applied to your roleplays. We recommend that you keep IC information to yourself and resist sharing, however we cannot control what you share in private conversations.</bodytext>
                <h2>Auto</h2>
                <bodytext>Auto is when you perform an action without giving the affected players a chance to respond. Your actions should detail their characters actions, but your actions towards other characters should be worded as attempts.</bodytext>
                <h2>Powerplay</h2>
                <bodytext>You are not allowed to operate someone else's character without their consent. What you write should always be in reference to your own character and their actions unless agreed otherwise.</bodytext>
                <h2>Powerplay</h2>
                <bodytext>You are not allowed to operate someone else's character without their consent. What you write should always be in reference to your own character and their actions unless agreed otherwise.</bodytext>

            <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
            <h2>Understanding the Setting restrictions</h2>
            <bodytext>Joining doesn't mean you are no longer allowed to run your venues, host your own RP events, or continue to operate in the independent role-player space in FFXIV. When you join this group, you are agreeing to keep that and your group activities separate. 
                Setting events will not be advertised in the party finder, and many of the events will be held in public spaces. Should anyone ask or request information about the setting, feel free to share and if they want to apply, please feel free to point them in the right 
                direction. However, the setting is separate.</bodytext>
            <bodytext>TLDR; This setting does not restrict you from any outside freedoms. I will not tell you to stop doing your FC events, your venues, or anything like that, but we ask that you respect the space we created with the setting.</bodytext>
            <h2>The Benefits & Honor System</h2>
            <bodytext>There is no gil. No monetary gain. No deeper incentive beyond roleplay. When you join you're joining because you just like roleplaying, you like writing and you want to write with other like minded RPers. The only thing joining will cost you is some time and effort.</bodytext>
