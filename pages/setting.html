                Aitiascope uses world state to create a cohesive coundation for the universe that characters will exist in. 
                It is a way for the players to understand not only the timeline, but the corresponding 
                world events that impact the current state of the universe.

                For 1.0, the world state is set in at Patch 4.0 in Final Fantasy 14. Admist the 
                attempted liberation of Ala Mhigo from the Garlean Empire and its subsequent failure, the Eorzean Alliance
                has initiated a call for aid. Countrymen across the three great continents are requested to 
                come together to supply the liberation effort with aid.

            </p>
            <p>
                <bodytext>
                Businesses, Orginizations, Free Comapnies and individuals are all called to action to support the liberation by
                fulfilling the requests of the Eorzean Alliance. However, this will require coordination, support and supplies
                of the different regions to contribute to the greater effort. Trade, deal, sell and organize
                with other players to contribute to the efforts of the liberation and rise to prominence.

                    Each corresponding region will have a resource used for contributing to the world state system. These resources are purposely picked for trading 
                    and sharing among different business, organizations, free companies and individuals. Anyone can turn in resources, but they must be attributed 
                    to a faction or free agent. There contributions will be tracked and used to cause changes or effects to
                    the world state.

                    These items will be announed at the start of the month. The items will be validated by name (the player that crafted it),
                    and attributed to a player or group and the region of the player or group. For example, if the alliance needs 1000
                    longs of Elm Lumber, players can contribute to the cause by crafting and turning in Elm Lumber. The Elm Lumber will be
                    only verified that the name on the item is a member of the community or their alternate character.
