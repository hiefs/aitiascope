                Aitiascope uses world state to create a cohesive foundation for the universe that characters will exist in. 
                It is a way for the players to understand not only the timeline, but the corresponding 
                world events that impact the current state of the universe.

                <bodytext>
                For A1.0, the World States' timeline is set in at Patch 4.0 in Final Fantasy 14. Admist the 
                attempted liberation of Ala Mhigo from the Garlean Empire and its subsequent failure, the Eorzean Alliance
                has initiated a call for aid. Countrymen across the three great continents are requested to 
                come together to supply the liberation effort with aid.

                <bodytext>
                Businesses, Orginizations, Free Comapnies and individuals are all called to action to support the liberation by
                fulfilling the requests of the Eorzean Alliance. However, this will require coordination, support and supplies
                of the different regions to contribute to the greater effort. Trade, deal, sell and organize
                with other players to contribute to the efforts of the liberation and rise to prominence.

            <p>
                <bodytext>
                    On a bi-weekly basis we will release events in the form of newsletters or announcements showing not only
                    the opportunity for community run events but a conjoined goal that different roleplayers can participate in or
                    host smaller internal or external events for.

            <p>
                <bodytext>
                    We encourage our members to host, connect, or participate in events among each other. we will collect and post any 
                    community specific events in the proper channels. These will be member only specified and we would ask that they are 
                    advertised this way as well.

                At the end of this two week period there will a public event for current members

                    Meet & Greets will be hosted monthly for existing, new and prospective members to attend. These are 
                    get togethers that are meant to be fun and introduce roleplayers to the community. We would ask that anyone 
                    that brings non-members to the meet and greets explain and make aware the context of the world state,
                    and the limitations we set in terms of guidelines and rules.
